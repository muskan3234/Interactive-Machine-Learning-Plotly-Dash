# Demand-Visualizer
# Model using Plotly-Dash

Design of interactive components for a machine learning which effectively visualize your data elegantly and 
critically evaluates the latent space of a 2-D dimensionaltiy reduction algorithm. Designed an interactive dropdown lists, radio buttons, and most importantly, scatter plots and bar charts that respond to your mouse's hover. These models can be used in Customer Segmentation of Hospital data. 

In today's , Corona Virus outbreak , analyzing the requirement and necessity of different Hospitals and Healthcare centre can be really tedious . Demand_Visualizer is a web application that I made using python and basic Exploratory Data Analysis ,to visualize the tons of , data daily generated efficiently and thus improving user health care experience . It can eliminate any errors and , Style Bar Charts and Overall Dashboard helps in extracitng useful insights machine learning algorithms used for analysis are Principal Component Analysis and  Variational Autoencoder.
